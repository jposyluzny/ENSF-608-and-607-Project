# ENSF-608-and-607-Project

This was a group project that implemented Java GUIs, client-server architecture, and a MySQL database. The project was meant to replicate a small-scale tool shop,
where the manager would have two GUIs, one for inventory, and one for registered customers. The GUIs had search, add, and delete functions, and the inventory GUI had 
a selling function. Any use of the GUIs would go through the client and server, and into the database, where the specified tool or customer would be queried, added, deleted,
or sold, and returned to the GUIs.
